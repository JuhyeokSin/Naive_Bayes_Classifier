# Naive_Bayes_Classifier

This is a hand-on implementation for a tutorial offered by [Analyticsvidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/naive-bayes-explained/?). It explains about the Naive Bayes Classifier and provides one simple problem and its solution in Python code.


### What is the Naive Bayes Classifier?
* According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier), in machine learning, naïve Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models.
* A Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature [(Analyticsvidhya)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/naive-bayes-explained/?).
